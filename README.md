# Remaking the "Roll a Ball" Unity3d tutorial in F#!

Basically I followed the first Unity3d tutorial using **F#** instead of C# or Javascript.

This is just a follow up, and I'm planning to make more improvements on the code, although I'm 100% I'll just make a fork from this so this can stay as a starting point.
